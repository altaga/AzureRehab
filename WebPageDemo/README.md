# WebPage DEMO:

You can test our API from our website deployed in Azure Static Web App service.

Instructions:

- Open the web page.
- Allow access to the camera.
- If you want to move away from the camera you can press the Delay button and that will give you a few extra seconds before the photo.
- Once you are ready press the Capture button, if you had some active delay a countdown will start, otherwise the photo will be taken instantly.
